# Duelist-Of-The-Aces
This game was made for the following Game jam: https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-133-fusion

I made this game with a lot of inspiration from Yugioh! Duelist of the Roses. If you find gameplay on youtube, you will notice the similarities.

The game was made with Godot and GDScript. Blender to make the 3d models and Aseprite for the textures. I love how the aesthetics ended up looking and it made me a lot more comfortable working on a 3d environment.

Here's how the game works:

Your objective is simple, either deplete your foe's life points to 0, or have the most cards on the field after 20 turns.

You deal damage by fighting your foes cards on the field, and summoning your own to fight against them! Check the power between the two and blast the enemy!

At the start of your turn you can move your leader (signified by the gold capsule) and summon a card (By pressing the Special action button and selecting a tile).

After that you are greeted with 5 cards. you can choose which to summon so long you have AP (Ace points) for it. AP fills up  by 4 every turn. You can fuse cards by pressing the Special action button on this screen and selecting with the special action button which ones you want to fuse.

Fusing happens one by one, the card will keep the type of the first card through the fusion, and for each fusion, the resulting number is the average but both cards (rounded up).

Fusing is a powerful tool to gain momentum, but you risk using up all your cards for it. And no fusion will likely give you the strongest K card.

Once its on the field, you have to wait until next turn to use it. However, once you can:

If the card is on a favorable terrain, it can move one extra space if it's flipped up (Let's say, 6 of diamonds: it gains favorable terrain on "Even" terrain and "Diamond" terrain).

This will reveal the card to your opponent, but it allows it to travel much farther per turn.

If 2 cards you own overlap: They simply fuse

If 2 opposing cards overlap, a battle begins. They numbers get compared and the one with a higher number wins.

If you have type advantage (Spades>Clubs>Hearts>Diamonds>Spades) you gain 1 extra point to the attack power, same if the combat happens in favorable terrain.

Once combat is done, you deal damage to foe's HP with the difference of attack power between the two cards.

Aces can beat any card, but deal 0 damage!
